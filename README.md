Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine-learning project for weather prediction. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict weather conditions based on historical data.

Table of Contents
- Introduction: Weather prediction is an important task that helps us plan our daily activities and make informed decisions. Machine learning techniques can be applied to weather data to create predictive models that can forecast future weather conditions. This project aims to explore various machine-learning algorithms and build a robust weather prediction model.
- Dataset: The dataset used in this project consists of historical weather data collected from Kaggle. It includes features such as Data, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine-learning models.
